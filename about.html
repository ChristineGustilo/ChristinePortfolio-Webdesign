<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;"> About me</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;"> When it comes to sport, I remember I joined a sports team when I was in 8th grade, but it wasn't like a serious game. <br> Every year, there's an event in our subdivision, my mother was the one who insisted me to join on the volleyball team. <br> I have a few friends who joined on that team that's why I didn't felt lonely and I have a bit experienced in playing voleyball because, me and <br> my friends used to play it every noon. Everyday we practice with our coach and I learned how to spike a ball. <br> Eventhough, we have more lose than wins, however,it was a great and unforgettable experience that I'll cherish forever.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;"> In the future, I wanted to learn how to play instruments such as piano, drums, and ukelele. I'm a type of person who can't live without <br> listening to music and whenever I watch people play instruments, it makes me think that "How can they be so good at playing such instrument?", <br> I know that it will be hard during the process but it will be worth it and as long as you're enjoying what you're doing, I think everything is possible.</p>
